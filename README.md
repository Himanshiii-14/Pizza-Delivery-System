# Pizza-Delivery-System
It is a online pizza ordering system using Node Js, Express Js and Mongo DB. It is able to order a pizza and get notifications about pizza status.

The Pizza Ordering System is a web application that enables users to order pizza and get updates on the status of their orders. The service offered consumers an easy way to purchase pizza online and was created using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

The project's primary goal is to make online pizza ordering for clients as simple as possible. When users access the application, they can choose from a list of available pizzas and place their order. Also, they can choose the pizza's size, designate the delivery location, and add toppings.

Once an order has been placed, the user can track their order status through the /orders route. They can view the estimated delivery time and receive notifications when their order is being prepared when it is out for delivery, and when it has been delivered.
The application is designed to make the ordering process as straightforward as possible while providing users with timely updates on the status of their orders.
